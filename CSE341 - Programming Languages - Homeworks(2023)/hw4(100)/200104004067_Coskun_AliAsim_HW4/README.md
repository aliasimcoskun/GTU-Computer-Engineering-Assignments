This repository contains the homework assignment for the course. It is divided into two main parts: an expert system implemented in Prolog and a decision tree for the Iris dataset.

## Part 1 - Expert System in Prolog

This part of the project includes the implementation of an expert system using Prolog.

- **main.pl**: The main Prolog file which integrates other modules and contains the primary logic.
- **map.pl**: Contains the map details used in the expert system.
- **objects.pl**: Defines the objects involved in the expert system.
- **personnel.pl**: Includes information about the personnel, such as their capacities and current locations.
- **places.pl**: Lists various places referenced in the expert system.

## Part 2 - Iris Decision Tree

This section of the project is focused on building and visualizing a decision tree classifier for the Iris dataset.

### Python Scripts and Decision Tree Visualization

- **build_tree.py**: A Python script to build and visualize the decision tree.
- **decision_tree_made_by_python.png**: The visual representation of the decision tree generated by the script.

#### Iris Dataset Files

- **bezdekIris.data**: An alternative version of the Iris dataset.
- **Index**: An index file listing the files included in the dataset.
- **iris.data**: The main dataset file containing measurements of Iris flowers.
- **iris.names**: Provides descriptive information about the Iris dataset.

### Prolog Implementation

- **classify.pl**: Prolog implementation of the decision tree, used for classifying instances based on the Iris dataset.

## README.md

- The README.md file (this document) provides an overview of the project structure and contents.

## Additional Documentation

### Directory Structures Text File

- **directory_structures.txt**: This file provides an alternative, plain-text representation of the project's directory structure. It is useful for quick reference or in environments where Markdown rendering is not available. This text file complements the detailed descriptions provided in this README and offers a straightforward, unformatted view of the file organization within the project.
